# AI & ML Internship - Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Hi! I'm **Keerthi**, and this is my completed submission for Task 1 of the AI & ML Internship.  
In this task, I focused on cleaning and preprocessing data to make it ML-ready.

---

## Overview

**Objective:**  
Prepare a raw dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical values, and removing outliers.

**Dataset Used:**  
Titanic Dataset

---

## Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Import & Exploration**  
   - Loaded the dataset using `pandas`  
   - Checked null values, data types, and basic stats using `.info()` and `.describe()`

2. **Handling Missing Values**  
   - Used mean/median for numerical columns  
   - Applied mode or dropped rows where necessary

3. **Encoding Categorical Features**  
   - Used `Label Encoding` and `One-Hot Encoding` where applicable

4. **Feature Scaling**  
   - Applied `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn` to normalize data

5. **Outlier Detection & Removal**  
   - Visualized outliers using `boxplots`  
   - Removed outliers using IQR method

## What I Learned

- Importance of data cleaning before ML modeling  
- Different ways to handle missing and categorical data  
- How scaling improves model performance  
- The impact of outliers and how to manage them

Thanks for reviewing my task! Looking forward to learning more in the upcoming internship tasks.
